        <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Pablo Saavedra, born in 1997 and raised in Rosario,
Argentina. I love both consuming and doing almost everything that (I
consider) involves a creative process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>Gaming</li>
<li>Cinema</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Art</li>
<li>‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
<p>I also like autum üçÇ</p>
<hr />
<p>I‚Äôm a full-stack developer with 5+ YOE, currently focusing on DevOps
tasks involving Ansible, Python, and Bash. I‚Äôm employed at a company
where I do a lot of hands-on coding.</p>
<p>In addition to handling maintenance work (because technical debt is
tautological) I also get to implement new features, which I really
enjoy.</p>
<p>Technologies I work with regularly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python (Django and vanilla)</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>Ansible</li>
<li>Bash</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôve also worked with many other languages on <a
href="https://pablos123.github.io/items/projects/projects.html">personal</a>
or university projects.</p>
<p>I use Linux as my daily driver both at home and at work, I enjoy
learning about it and tinkering with my <a
href="https://github.com/pablos123/environment">environment</a>.</p>
<p>I have virtually no contact with Windows.</p>
<hr />
<p>I try to use LLMs as little as possible. I might rely on them for
naming or grammar discussions, but I prefer to keep them away from my
code.</p>
<hr />
<p>Languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spanish (Native)</li>
<li>English (Fluent)</li>
</ul>
