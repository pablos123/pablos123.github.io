# dptn

Our servers don't have well-organized versioning. I was working on a task that required knowing exactly which versions of certain packages were shipped with specific Debian releases. To solve this, I parsed the packages' news and got the job done. I'm not sure if this was the correct approach, but I couldn't find a better one. I couldn't rely on the servers' apt cache for example.
