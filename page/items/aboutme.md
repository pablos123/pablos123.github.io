Hi, I'm Pablo Saavedra, born in 1997 and raised in Rosario, Argentina. I'm passionate about:

- Drumming
- Reading
- Programming
- ...

I like the fact that they all involve a strong creative process and rely heavily on imagination.

I also like [cinema](https://letterboxd.com/pablos123/) and autum üçÇ.

______________________________________________________________________

I'm a full-stack developer with 5+ YOE, currently focusing on DevOps tasks involving Ansible, Python, and Bash. I'm employed at a company where I do a lot of hands-on coding.

In addition to handling maintenance work (because technical debt is tautological) I also get to implement new features, which I really enjoy.

Technologies I work with regularly:

- Ansible
- Bash
- Python (Django and vanilla)
- Perl

I've also worked with many other languages on [personal](https://pablos123.github.io/items/projects/projects.html) or [university](https://github.com/pablos123/dump/tree/main/lcc) projects.

I use Linux as my daily driver both at home and at work, I enjoy learning about it and tinkering with my [environment](https://github.com/pablos123/environment).

I have virtually no contact with other operating systems.
