I'm Pablo Saavedra, born (in 1997) and living in Rosario-Argentina. Not in a particular order I like a lot:

- Reading
- Programming
- Music
- Cinema
- Gaming
- Coffe

But love a lot more too.

I'm a full stack developer with 5+ YOE, currently doing mainly DevOps tasks involving Ansible, Python and Bash.

I'm currently employed in a company in which I do a lot of coding. Like really coding.

Besides doing a lot of maintainance, because the technical debt is tautological, I get to implement a lot of new things.

I work or worked a lot with these programming languages:

- Python (Django and vanilla)
- Ansible
- Bash
- Perl
- Javascript
- HTML, CSS

I worked less or make personal or university projects with others:

- C
- C++
- Lua
- PHP
- R
- Erlang
- Haskell
- Racket

I'm currently studying CS and I don't think I will be finishing soon. I like it though.

I try to use LLM's the least possible.

I probably will use them for discussing naming or grammatical problems, I try to keep them away from my code projects.

Languages:

- Spanish (Native)
- English
