Hi, I'm Pablo Saavedra, born in 1997 and raised in Rosario, Argentina. I love both consuming and doing almost everything that (I consider) involves a creative process:

- Programming
- Reading
- Gaming
- Cinema
- Music
- Art
- ...

I also like autum üçÇ

I'm a full-stack developer with 5+ YOE, currently focusing on DevOps tasks involving Ansible, Python, and Bash. I'm employed at a company where I do a lot of hands-on coding.

In addition to handling maintenance work (because technical debt is tautological) I also get to implement new features, which I really enjoy.

Technologies I work with regularly:

- Python (Django and vanilla)
- Perl
- Ansible
- Bash

I've also worked with many other languages on [personal](https://pablos123.github.io/items/projects/projects.html) or university projects.

I use Linux as my daily driver both at home and at work, I enjoy learning about it and tinkering with my [environment](https://github.com/pablos123/environment).

I have virtually no contact with Windows.

I try to use LLMs as little as possible. I might rely on them for naming or grammar discussions, but I prefer to keep them away from my code.

- Spanish (Native)
